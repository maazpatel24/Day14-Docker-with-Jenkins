# Project Problem Statement
A development team needs to establish a basic CI/CD pipeline for a web application. The goal is to automate version control, containerization, building, testing, and deployment processes.

# Deliverables
## Git Repository:
- Create a Git repository: Initialize a new repository for the web application.
- Branching Strategy:
    + Set up main and develop branches.
    + Create a feature branch for a new feature or bug fix.

- Add Configuration Files:
    + Create a .gitignore file to exclude files like logs, temporary files, etc.
    + Create a README.md file with a project description, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
## Docker Configuration:
- Dockerfile:
    + Write a Dockerfile to define how to build the Docker image for the web application.
- Docker Ignore File:
    + Create a .dockerignore file to exclude files and directories from the Docker build context.
- Image Management:
    + Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile.
    + Push the built Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
## Jenkins Configuration:
- Jenkins Job Setup:
    + Create a Jenkins job to pull code from the Git repository.
    + Configure Jenkins to build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
    + Set up Jenkins to run tests on the Docker image.
    + Configure Jenkins to push the Docker image to the container registry after a successful build.
- Jenkins Pipeline:
    + Create a Jenkinsfile to define the CI/CD pipeline stages, including build, test, and deploy.
## Ansible Playbook:
- Basic Playbook Creation:
    + Develop an Ansible playbook to automate the deployment of the Docker container.
- Playbook Tasks:
    + Install Docker on the target server (if Docker is not already installed).
    + Pull the Docker image from the container registry.
    + Run the Docker container with the required configurations.
- Inventory File:
    + Create an inventory file specifying the target server(s) for deployment.
